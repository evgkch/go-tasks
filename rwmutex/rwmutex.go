// A RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// If a goroutine holds a RWMutex for reading and another goroutine might
// call Lock, no goroutine should expect to be able to acquire a read lock
// until the initial read lock is released. In particular, this prohibits
// recursive read locking. This is to ensure that the lock eventually becomes
// available; a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the
// lock.

	r chan uint
	w chan struct{}

// New creates *RWMutex.

		r: make(chan uint, 1),
		w: make(chan struct{}, 1),
	}
	rw.r <- 0
	return rw
}

// RLock locks rw for reading.
//
// It should not be used for recursive read locking; a blocked Lock
// call excludes new readers from acquiring the lock. See the
// documentation on the RWMutex type.

// on entry to RUnlock.

// not locked for writing on entry to Unlock.

// As with Mutexes, a locked RWMutex is not associated with a particular
// goroutine. One goroutine may RLock (Lock) a RWMutex and then
// arrange for another goroutine to RUnlock (Unlock) it.
